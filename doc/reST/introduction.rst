Introduction

Increase in demand for high resolution video along with increase in the
consumption of video can be met only with the supply of a high
efficiency codec. The x265 codec from MCW aims at providing the most
efficient video encoder with the highest possible quality at even the
lowest given bit rate.

About HEVC
==========

The High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is the latest generation video
compression standard. This standard was developed by the ISO/IEC Moving
Picture Experts Group (MPEG) and ITU-T Video Coding Experts Group
(VCEG), through their Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC).
HEVC is also known as ISO/IEC 23008-2 MPEG-H Part 2 and ITU-T H.265.
HEVC provides superior video quality and up to twice the data
compression as the previous standard (H.264/MPEG-4 AVC). HEVC can
support 8K Ultra High Definition video, with a picture size up to
8192x4320 pixels.

About x265
==========

The primary objective of x265 is to become the best H.265/HEVC encoder
available anywhere, offering the highest compression efficiency and the
highest performance on a wide variety of hardware platforms. The x265
encoder is available as an open source library, published under the
GPLv2 license. It is also available under a commercial license similar
to the x264s commercial license.

x265 is developed by `MulticoreWare <http://www.multicorewareinc.com>`_, leaders
in high performance software solutions, with backing from leading video technology
providers including `Telestream <http://www.telestream.com>`_ and
`Doremi Labs <http://www.doremilabs.com>`_ (and other companies who want to remain
anonymous at this time), and with contributions from open source developers.
x265 leverages many of the outstanding video encoding features and optimizations
from the x264 AVC encoder project.

The x265 software is available for free under the GNU GPL 2 license,
from https://bitbucket.org/multicoreware/x265.  For commercial companies
that wish to distribute x265 without being subject to the open source
requirements of the GPL 2 license, commercial licenses are available
with competitive terms.  Contact license@x265.com to inquire about
commercial license terms.  

While x265 is primarily designed as a video encoder software library, a
command-line executable is provided to facilitate testing and
development.  We expect x265 to be utilized in many leading video
hardware and software products and services in the coming months.
